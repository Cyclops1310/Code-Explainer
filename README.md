‚öôÔ∏è Execution Steps 
1Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy the Model on Modal Labs
Use starcoder_reviewer.py to host the StarCoder2-15B model.
This script will:

Create a Modal application.

Load the bigcode/starcoder2-15b model from Hugging Face.

Set up an API endpoint for sending code and receiving explanations.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the Backend API
Once deployed, Modal will provide an API endpoint, for example:

php-template
Copy
Edit
https://<your-app-name>--<username>.modal.run
This API:

Accepts POST requests containing source code.

Returns AI-generated explanations in response.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Explainer Pipeline
Use explainer_pipeline.py (client-side) to:

Send code to the API endpoint.

Receive and display the explanation in a human-readable format.
